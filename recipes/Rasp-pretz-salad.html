    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups pretzels</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Middle</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>8 ounces Cool Whip, thawed (or 1 Â½ cups heavy cream, whipped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Top</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (3-ounce) boxes raspberry jello (or one 6-ounce box)</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>12 ounces frozen raspberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Place pretzels in a large ziploc bag and crush; not too fine, leave in consistnet pieces</li>
        <li>Transfer to a bowl and add sugar and melted butter, stirring to combine</li>
        <li>Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with the bottom of a measuring cup. 
            Bake for 10 minutes, then remove from oven and cool completely</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar with an electric hand mixer until smooth</li>
        <li>Fold in the Cool Whip with a spatula, then spread over the pretzel crust in an even layer, 
            taking care to press all the way to the edges of the pan to create a seal that will prevent 
            the jello layer from seeping through</li>
        <li>Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>While the middle layer chills in the fridge, microwave the water for 3-5 minutes, until boiling, 
            then stir jello into the hot water until dissolved</li>
        <li>Add frozen raspberries and stir</li>
        <li>Once the cream cheese layer has chilled and the jello has cooled, gently pour the raspberry jello mixture over the cream cheese layer</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until the jello is completely set, around 2 to 3 hours. Slice into squares and serve</li>
    </ol>
